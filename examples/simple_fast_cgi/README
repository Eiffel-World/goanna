Simple FastCGI
--------------

This example demonstrates request handling using the FastCGI library. The
example responds to a request by displaying all request parameters and
environment variables on an HTML page.

Usage
-----

Register the server in Apache by adding the following line to httpd.conf:

	FastCgiExternalServer "/home/httpd/fcgi-bin/simple" \
		-host localhost:8000 -idle-timeout 4000

Change localhost and the port to the machine and port you will be running the
server on.

Start the server passing two command line arguments for the port and backlog
request size.

You can then execute the request by entering the following URI into your
browser:

	http://localhost/fcgi-bin/simple
