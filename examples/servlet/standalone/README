Project Goanna Example
----------------------

Servlet
-------

This example demonstrates the different types of servlet that Project Goanna
supports. The servlet types include:

	simple - standard hard-coded HTML page generation

	dom - a dynamically created and streamed DOM document

	xmle - a streamed DOM object created from an XMLE generated temmplate

Usage
-----

You must register the servlet manager in Apache. Add a line similar to the
following to httpd.conf:

	FastCgiExternalServer "/home/httpd/fcgi-bin/servlet_server" \
		-port localhost:8000 -idle-timeout 4000

Change localhost and the port to the location and port that the server
application will be running on. 

The server must be given a port number and backlog size as command line
arguments when it is executed.

Then run the server either on the command line or within your IDE and 
request the following page in your browser:

	http://localhost/fcgi-bin/servlet_server

You will receive a "Not Found" page. This is because each of the servlets is
registered with a path name. To request a particular servlet add the path
name "simple", "dom" or "xmle" to the URI. For example:

	http://localhost/fcgi-bin/servlet_server/simple

will request a response from the "simple" servlet.

NOTE: To call the xmle servlet you must have the binary DOM file from the
xml file test.xml located in the execution directory. To generate this file
run the XMLE tool over the file test.xml located in the 'templates' directory
and copy the file to the execution directory (eg, the EIFGEN/W_code directory
for ISE Eiffel).
