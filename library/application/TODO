Using the |= operator seems to grash goa_build; this is why my script names are currently listed in goa_common.rnc

refactor goa_build.e to break out creation feature into multiple sub features (moving local attributes to class attributes as necessary) in order to reduce deeply nested structure and enhance readibility.

Need a script to re-build the included xslt directories.

goa_build should build a select of valid values for the span element which should be exactly the same as the values for the class element.

goa_build should be able to handle includes that don't involve other schemas (i.e.allow sharing attributes between two different schemas).

goa_build should be able to handle patterns that define groups of elements (i.e. pattern = previous_pattern1 | previous_pattern2)

Documentation (including doc/application.xml) should have a build.eant file, with a target of install, and this should be called from the install target of the build.eant
file in the parent directory.

Convert goa_build from eclop to Gobo command line parsing.

Remove generated files from xml/goa_common, xml/goa_page, and xml/goa_redirect directories and instead create a geant install task to create them.

Use a gelex program rather than trang to convert Relax-NG Compact Syntax files to Relax-NG.

The instructions for starting a project include stages where you copy
files, delete CVS directories, and choose an application name. This
should all be done by a command, which should prompt the user for an
application name, target directory names, etc. (command line prompts,
for portability).

Split application.xml up into 
multiple files (each a <chapter>, see the build.eant file in
$GOBO/doc/xml/xslt to see how these are combined without an
over-arching <book>

Consider adding support for the html id, title, and lang attributes to goa_common

I read through the rest of the documentation, but felt lost most of
the time. I shall have some further suggestions to make later, but
first it seems clear to me that we shall need an overview picture.
Take a look at
http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/userdocs/concepts/index.html 
to see if it gives you some ideas.
Actually, we also need a similar overview for servlets, and especially
FastCGI servlets, in $GOANNA/doc/servlets, I think, and you should
include a broken link to this hypothetical documentation as something
to be read before reading further with your own overview.

Under some circumstances, common.xsl creates unused local variables
name_index and value_index.  The template should be smart enough to
add those variables to feature only when they are actually needed.
The offending template is:

  <xsl:template match="rng:ref" mode="adding_elements">

Change Goanna design so that connector may be selected at run time
instead of compile time.

If an item has only { text } as content, then GOA_BUILD should
add feature start_element as well as add_element (new_text: STRING).
Currently there is no way to add text except through the attribute.
Work around: define content as { text | text_item }

GOA_REQUEST_PARAMETER: Add an option to append suffix number to
on_click_script.  This would allow for creation of suffix specific
scripts. Currently, schema based validating of on-click script is
disabled because NL needs suffix specific scripts.

DONE ====================================

goa_build -g option seems to erase the goa_common.rnc and goa_common.css files.  It's shouldn't, and it's quite annoying.
