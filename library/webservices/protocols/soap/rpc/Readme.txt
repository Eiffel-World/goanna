This file describes the Goanna binding of the SOAP Data Model to
Eiffel classes for RPC routines using SOAP encoding.

enc:ref/enc:id relationships are not generated by the binding.

Input parameters to an RPC routine MUST be of type GOA_SOAP_VALUE.
There is one descendant of GOA_SOAP_VALUE for each simple type
defined in the encoding, plus one for arrays, and one for structs.

A non-Void return value MUST be of type GOA_SOAP_VALUE.

In/out and Output parameters are not supported for Goanna SOAP
servers.
