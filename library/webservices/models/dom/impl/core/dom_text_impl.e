         -- Breaks this Text node into two Text nodes at the specified
         -- `offset', keeping both in the tree as siblings. This node
         -- then only contains all the content up to the `offset' point.
         -- And a new Text node, which is inserted as the next sibling
         -- of this node, contains all the content at and after
         -- the `offset' point.
         -- Parameters
         --    offset   The offset at which to split, starting from 0.
         -- Return Value
         --    The new Text node.
