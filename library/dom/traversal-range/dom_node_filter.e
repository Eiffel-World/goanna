	description: "Filters are objects that know how to 'filter out' nodes. If a%
		% DOM_NODE_ITERATOR or DOM_TREE_WALKER is given a filter, it applies the filter%
		% before it returns the next node. If the filter says to accept the node, the%
		% iterator returns it; otherwise, the iterator looks for the next node and%
		% pretends that the node that was rejected was not there."
