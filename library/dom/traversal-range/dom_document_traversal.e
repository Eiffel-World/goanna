	create_node_iterator (root: DOM_NODE; what_to_show: INTEGER;
		filter: DOM_NODE_FILTER; entity_reference_expansion: BOOLEAN): DOM_NODE_ITERATOR is
			-- Create a new node iterator over the subtree rooted at the specified node.
			-- Parameters:
			-- root - The node which will be iterated together with its children. The
			--		iterator is initially positioned just before this node. The
			--		what_to_show flags and the filter, if any, are not considered when
			--		setting this position.
			-- what_to_show - This flag specifies which node types may appear in the
			--		logical view of the tree presented by the iterator. See the
			--		description of iterator for the set of possible values. These flags
			--		can be combined using 'bit_or'
			-- filter - The filter to be used with this node iterator, or Void to
			--		indicate no filter.
			-- entity_reference_expansion - the value of this flag determines whether
			--		entity reference nodes are expanded.
