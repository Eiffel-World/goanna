         -- If this attribute was explicitly given a value in the original
         -- document, this is `True'; otherwise, it is `False'. Note that
         -- the implementation is in charge of this attribute, not the
         -- user. If the user changes the value of the attribute (even if
         -- it ends up having the same value as the default value) then
         -- the `specified' flag is automatically flipped to `True'. To
         -- re-specify the attribute as the default value from the DTD,
         -- the user must delete the attribute. The implementation will
         -- then make a new attribute available with `specified' set to `False'
         -- and the default value (if one exists).
         -- In summary:
         --    If the attribute has an assigned value in the document
         --    then specified is `True', and the value is the assigned value.
         --    If the attribute has no assigned value in the document and
         --    has a default value in the DTD, then `specified' is `False',
         --    and the value is the default value in the DTD.
         --    If the attribute has no assigned value in the document and
         --    has a value of #IMPLIED in the DTD, then the attribute does
         --    not appear in the structure model of the document.
