Project Goanna Tools
--------------------

The tools distributed with Project Goanna include:

	xmle - The XML/HTML to Eiffel compiler. This tool is similar to the
		XMLC tool from the Enhydra Java framework 
		(http://www.enhydra.org). XMLE provides the means to convert
		an XML or HTML file into a DOM object representation. XMLE
		can then store the DOM object structure in a binary form
		on disk, called a BDOM file. This structure can be retrieved
		and modified in memory before streaming to a client.

		NOTE: Currently the XMLE tool only supports XML parsing. We
		still have to build an HTML parser to support HTML.

	bdom_viewer - This tool can read a BDOM file and stream it to 
		standard out.

See the individual tools directories for more details.
