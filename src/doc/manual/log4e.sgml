  <title>Logging (log4e)</title>
  <para>The <literal>log4e</literal> library provides a complete framework 
    for logging messages in an application. Logged messages can be processed 
    based on priority and content and sent to multiple destinations. A destination, 
    in Goanna log4e, is known as an appender. The types of appenders include 
    files and the NT event log.
  </para>
  <para>The classes in <literal>log4e</literal> are a direct port of Jakarta log4j 
    which can be found at <ulink url="http://jakarta.apache.org">the Apache
    Jakarta project</ulink>. For the most part, the source 
    has been ported as is. A number of Eiffel-like improvements have been made 
    such as appropriate contracts, and the use of generic types. The general 
    struture and usage of the library remains very similar to the original 
    Java version.
  </para>
  
  <section>
    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>The central object of the log4e library is the
      <emphasis>hierarchy</emphasis>. The hierarchy holds each of the
      logging <emphasis>categories</emphasis> on which messages 
      can be logged. As its name suggests, the hierarchy maintains the
      collection of categories in a hierarchy with a predefined root 
      category at the top and user defined sub-categories beneath.
    </para>
    <para>Each category has a name, a logging priority and zero or 
      more <emphasis>appenders</emphasis>. Different types
      of appenders can log messages to different destinations, be it 
      a file, NT event log or socket. They can also format those
      messages any way required and filter messages based on priority 
      and/or message content.
    </para>

    <title>The Category Hierarchy</title>
    <para>The category hierarchy, represented by the class 
      <classname>LOG_HIERARCHY</classname>, holds a collection of 
      categories that you define. Multiple independant hierarchies can exist within 
      an application. However, it is more common
      to use one hierarchy with multiple categories to represent different 
      logging areas.
    </para>
    <para><classname>LOG_HIERARCHY</classname> provides methods for accessing 
      categories and setting hierarchy level
      logging priorities. The hierarchy is the only object that can create 
      instances of categories 
      (<classname>LOG_CATEGORY</classname> and maintains the parents 
      of each category internally. In addition, each hierarchy
      instance initialises a <emphasis>root</emphasis> category that resides at 
      the top of the category hierarchy. If required,
      the root category can be used as the sole logging category in an
      application.
    </para>
    
    <section>
      <title>Categories</title>
      <para>The category hierarchy is determine by the names given to 
	each category&mdash;a dot in the name indicates a 
	parent-child relationship between categories. For example, 
	if a category is created with the name 
	<literal>a.b</literal> it identifies the category named 
	<literal>b</literal> with the parent category named 
	<literal>a</literal>. When this category is created the category 
	hierarchy will also instantiate any intermediate
	parent categories if needed. For the category named 
	<literal>a.b</literal> the hierarchy will create a category
	named <literal>a</literal> if it doesn't already exist and set 
	it as the parent of <literal>b</literal>. A category
	name can contain an arbitrary number of parts separated by 
	dots ('<literal>.</literal>'). The hierarchy will manage the parents
	automatically for you.
      </para>
      <para>The naming of categories follows your requirements for 
	logging. Category hierarchies can be defined that
	provide logging categories for an application as a whole, 
	subsystems and/or source modules. You can create very simple
	logging hierarchies, such as using only the root category, 
	through to very complex hierarchies, such as providing a 
	category for every source file or module in your application.
      </para>
      <para>A category can only be created by the category hierarchy by 
	calling the <function>category</function>
	function of <classname>LOG_CATEGORY</classname>. The sole 
	parameter to this function specifies the name of the category
	you would like to access. The hierarchy will create the 
	category (and its parents) if required and return the category
	to you. This ensures that there will only be one instance 
	of a named category in each category hierarchy and that it is
	correctly positioned in the hierarchy. Once you have a 
	reference to the category you can then configure the category's
	priority and appenders and log messages to it. For example, given the
	following variables declarations:
      </para>
      <programlisting>
	hierarchy: LOG_HIERARCHY
	category: LOG_CATEGORY
      </programlisting>
      <para>
	you can create a category named <literal>server.access</literal> and
	assign it to the variable <varname>category</varname> using:
      </para>
      <programlisting>
	category := hierarchy.category ("server.access")
      </programlisting>
      <para>Messages can be sent to a category using the routines 
	<function>debugging</function><footnote><para>The original 
	    log4j library uses the routine name 
	    <function>debug</function> however this is a reserved word 
	    in Eiffel and has therefore been renamed 
	    <function>debugging</function></para></footnote>,
	<function>warn</function>, <function>info</function>, 
	<function>error</function>, <function>fatal</function> or
	<function>log</function> to log at predefined priorities or 
	a specified priority in the case of <function>log</function>. 
      </para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Priorities</title>
      <para>Each log message has a priority which can determine
	what should be done with the message, whether it should be written to a
	log file or discarded. All log4e priorities are defined in the class
      <classname>LOG_PRIORITY_CONSTANTS</classname> of type
      <classname>LOG_PRIORITY</classname> and range from the lowest priority
      <constant>Debug_p</constant> through <constant>Info_p</constant>,
      <constant>Warning_p</constant> and <constant>Error_p</constant>, to the
      highest priority <constant>Fatal_p</constant>.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Logging</title>
      <para>
	To send a log message of each priority to the category we created earlier,
	you can write:
      </para> 
      <programlisting>
	category.debugging ("This is a debug message")
	category.info ("This is an information message")
	category.warn ("This is a warning message")
	category.error ("This is an error message")
	category.fatal ("This is a fatal message")
	category.log (hierarchy.Info_p, "This is another information message")
      </programlisting>
      <para>
	Each of the statements send a message to the
	<literal>server.access</literal> category with different priorities. The
	final statement explicitly logs a message with the priority
	<constant>Info_p</constant> as defined in
	<classname>LOG_PRIORITY_CONSTANTS</classname>. Many of the log4e classes
	inherit (sometimes indirectly) from
	<classname>LOG_PRIORITY_CONSTANTS</classname> and therefore provide
	access to all of the predefined priority constants, as used in the
	<function>log</function> example above. We could just as easily
	inherited from the <classname>LOG_PRIORITY_CONSTANTS</classname> class
	to access the priority directly.
      </para>
      <para>
	All of the logging routines take an object of type
	<classname>ANY</classname> as the <parameter>message</parameter>
	parameter thus allowing objects of arbitrary types to be logged. The
	category calls <function>out</function> on the object to convert it to a
	string that can then be written to the appropriate log. Basic types,
	such as <classname>INTEGER</classname>, <classname>DOUBLE</classname>
	and <classname>CHARACTER</classname>, all define reasonable
	implementations of <function>out</function>. If you need to log
	objects other than basic types you will need to redefine
	<function>out</function> to return the
	<classname>STRING</classname> representation you require. For example,
	given the following class <classname>USER</classname>: 
      </para>
      <programlisting>
	class USER
	inherit
	    ANY
	        redefine out end
        creation 
	    make
        feature -- Initialisation

            make (first, last: STRING) is
                do
                    first_name := first
                    surname := last
                end

	feature -- Access

	    first_name: STRING

	    surname: STRING

	feature -- Basic routines

	    out: STRING is
	        do
	            create Result.make (100)
	            Result.append ("USER first_name=" + first_name)
	            Result.append (" surname=" + surname)
	        end

	end -- class USER
      </programlisting>
      <para>
	We can create an instance and log details about that instance to a
	category by passing the instance itself: 
      </para>
      <programlisting>
	create user.make ("Jim", "Smith")
	category.info (user)
      </programlisting>
      <para>
	The string that will be sent to the log will be: <computeroutput>USER
	first_name=Jim surname=Smith</computeroutput>
