Project Goanna Release Notes
----------------------------

Release 0.1 (Proof-of-Concept)
------------------------------
6 Jan 2001

The first public release of Project Goanna includes enough implemented
functionality to demonstrate the capabilities of the technology. The classes
included with the release have many skeleton code fragments and require
further development before they will become more widely useful.

The following known bugs and issues need to be resolved:

o The Apache mod_fastcgi module has a few problems. Especially under
Windows. 

o Error handling is not performed in all areas. Integration with a standard
error handling mechanism (eg, EEL) needs to be done.

o The DOM interface utilises assertions to remove the need for exception 
handling. The implementation therefore does not conform to the standard
exactly. However, it does simplify the API. (I believe this is the right
decision, but time will tell. -- GM).

o The DS_HASH_TABLE class is used in a number of areas to handle named
collections. The hash table implementation is a little heavy weight for some
of the areas it has been used. In particular, as the implementation for
DOM_NAMED_NODE_LIST. A more light-weight associative array could be used in
these cases.
